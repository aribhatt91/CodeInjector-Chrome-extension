# Code Injector

This is a small Chrome extension that allows you to inject JS, CSS and HTML snippets into a Web Page. 

The folder named 'test' contains 3 files index.html, script.js and style.css. As the names suggest, you may add the respective snippets for HTML, JS and CSS in these files. Download the source code and load it as a Chrome extension from your local machine.

HTML snippets will be appended to the body. You may use templates in the HTML file and inject them using JavaScript.

script tags embedded within the HTML content won't be executed unless your page supports jQuery.
